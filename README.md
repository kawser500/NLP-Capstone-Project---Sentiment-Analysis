# NLP Capstone Project - Sentiment-Analysis

This is a capstone Natural Language Processing (NLP) project utilising the spaCy and TextBlob library in order to perform sentiment analysis on amazon product reviews.

The CSV file is attached and taken from a publicly available kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datafiniti/consumer-reviews-of-amazon-products) in order to perform sentiment analysis. 

This project utilises the small english language module in spaCy to allow for fast and efficient processing. 

The sentiment analysis is undertaken using TextBlob. An alternative method for performing sentiment analysis using spaCy transformers is also included in a docstring at the end of the file.
