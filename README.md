# NLP Capstone Project - Sentiment-Analysis

This is a capstone Natural Language Processing (NLP) project utilising the spaCy and TextBlob library in order to perform sentiment analysis on amazon product reviews.

The CSV file is attached and taken from a publicly available kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datafiniti/consumer-reviews-of-amazon-products) in order to perform sentiment analysis. 

This project utilises the small english language module in spaCy to allow for fast and efficient processing. 

The sentiment analysis is undertaken using TextBlob. An alternative method for performing sentiment analysis using spaCy transformers is also included in a docstring at the end of the file. 

A PDF file containing a report on this project has also been included in the repository. This report provides an overview of the project as well as highlights the strengths and weaknesses of using TextBlob for sentiment analysis.

## Installation

Download the attached CSV file in the repository named "amazon_product_reviews.csv". 
Once the CSV file has been downloaded, the sentiment_analysis.py file should run as expected.
